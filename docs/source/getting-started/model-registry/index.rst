Tutorial Overview
=================

The Model Registry is a centralized model store, set of APIs, and UI, to collaboratively manage the 
full lifecycle of an MLflow Model. It provides model lineage (which MLflow experiment and run 
produced the model), model versioning, model aliasing, model tagging, and annotations.

In this tutorial, you will get up and running with the MLflow model registry in the least amount of
steps possible. The topics in this tutorial cover:

* Registering a model programmatically to the Model Registry while logging.
* Viewing the model in the MLflow UI.
* Referencing a logged model.
* Loading a logged model for inference.
* Aliasing model versions.
